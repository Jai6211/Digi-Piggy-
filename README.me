 1. Website Conceptualization  

 Mission Statement  
The goal of DigiPiggy is to give people a simple way to save money online just like they save coins in a piggy bank at home. Instead of putting cash into a physical box, users will link their bank account and move small amounts of money into DigiPiggy whenever they want. This makes saving money more fun and easier, especially for students and families. It feels like the old style piggy bank, but in a modern digital way.  

2. Target Users  

a) Students and Young Adults  
- *Demographics and Interests:* Age 18–30, mostly college students or fresh employees. They use online banking and mobile apps daily.  
- *Needs:* A simple and fun way to save even if they don’t have big salaries. They want to build the habit of saving.  
- *How DigiPiggy supports them:* Students can transfer even $1 or $2 into DigiPiggy anytime they want, just like dropping coins in a piggy bank.  

b) Families and Parents  
- *Demographics and Interests:* Adults 25–50 who manage household budgets. They want financial stability and to teach their children about savings.  
- *Needs:* A way to save together as a family and show kids how saving works.  
- *How DigiPiggy supports them:* Parents can make family accounts, set goals like vacation or education funds, and kids can watch the savings grow step by step.  

 c) General Everyday Users  
- *Demographics and Interests:* Any adult with a bank account, age 18–60. They may not have time to plan savings in detail.  
- *Needs:* A safe and easy way to set aside money they don’t want to spend.  
- *How DigiPiggy supports them:* The website acts as a digital piggy bank where they can store small amounts of money and track progress easily.  

 3. Main Functionalities  

1. *User Registration and Login* – Users create secure accounts and log in with password or OTP.  
2. *Bank Account Linking* – Users can connect their bank account safely to DigiPiggy.  
3. *Manual Savings Deposit* – Users decide when and how much money they want to move into DigiPiggy.  
4. *Digital Piggy Bank View* – A page that shows how the balance is growing, like a piggy filling up.  
5. *Goal Setting* – Users can create goals (for example: new phone, family trip, or emergency fund).  
6. *Progress Tracking* – Graphs or progress bars show how close users are to their goals.  
7. *Notifications and Reminders* – Users get reminders to save regularly and alerts when goals are close.  
8. *Secure Transactions* – All money transfers are protected using encryption.  

Unique Selling Points (USPs)  
There are already some apps and bank features that help people save money. For example, Acorns and Chime in the U.S. use auto round-up savings, and Paytm Piggybank in India lets people save small amounts. But most of these focus on automatic saving or are part of bigger banking apps which look complicated.  

Our DigiPiggy is different because it works just like a real piggy bank but in a digital way. Instead of the system saving money automatically, here the user decides when and how much they want to save. Even if it is just one dollar, they can transfer it into DigiPiggy, just like dropping coins in a piggy bank at home.  

We also focus on making saving fun. The app will show a piggy bank filling up, progress bars for goals, and reminders to encourage saving. Families can also use DigiPiggy together, and parents can open piggy banks for kids so they learn money habits early.  

So DigiPiggy is not just another finance app. It is a habit-building tool that gives users the same happiness of saving coins in a piggy bank, but in a digital form.  

 4. Preliminary Development Plan  
 Phase 1: Research and Analysis  
We will study how students, families, and shopkeepers save money now. We will also look at competitors like Paytm Piggybank and Chime to find what they don’t provide, especially the “manual piggy bank” experience.  

 Phase 2: Design  
We will design DigiPiggy to be colorful, friendly, and mobile-first. The layout will be simple with easy navigation. The piggy bank icon will fill up as users save, so they feel motivated. Accessibility will be considered for all users.  

 Phase 3: Development  
- *Front End:* React.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.  
- *Back End:* Node.js with Express.  
- *Database:* MySQL to store accounts, transactions, and goals.  
- *API Integration:* Secure bank linking with services like Plaid or similar.  

Phase 4: Testing  
- *Unit Testing:* Test each small feature separately.  
- *User Testing:* Let a group of students and parents use it and share feedback.  
- *Performance Testing:* Check if the system works well when many people save at the same time.  
- *Security Testing:* Ensure money transfers and accounts are safe.  

 Phase 5: Launch and Maintenance  
We will first release a beta version for a small group. After feedback, we will improve and launch publicly. In maintenance, we will fix bugs, add features, and maybe introduce challenges or rewards for saving.

5. Collaboration Requirement  

Each student in our group will contribute to the README.md and future development.  
- *Shreeram* will write the Mission Statement and Target Users.  
- *Jagadishwar* will work on Functionalities and Development Plan.
